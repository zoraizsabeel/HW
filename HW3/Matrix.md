# matrix analysis:
    - to multiply the matrix we are sing three forloops interlaces with each other
        - every forloop iterates a different amount of times making the complexity:
            - O(N*M*E):
            - where N is the number of items in row_A
            - M is the number of items in cols_B
            - E is the number of items in cols_A
