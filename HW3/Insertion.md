# Analysis:
    - Insertion sort uses two forloops within the algorithm
    - for loop 1:
        selects a number to be compared with:
    - for loop 2: 
        goes throughout the entire array comparing each element with arr[i]
    Time Complexity:
        - n^2 when array is not sorted or patially sorted and n when array is sorted becuase only the first forloop iterates through the array.
