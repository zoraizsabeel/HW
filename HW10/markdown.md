# highlevel approach
  -  iterative approach
  -  uses breadth-first search
# iteration:
  - creation of queues that hold the values of tree nodes
  - while loop that places values inside queue to levels linked list
  - places children into queue/repeat (through for loop)
  - eventually input all levels into list of list and print
