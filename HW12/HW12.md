# high level perspective
     -Use either prims of kruskals algorithm to create the minimum spanning tree
# Kruskals:
    - create adjacency list and insert pipes values for ease of access
    - add wells to adjacency list with holder looking like a weight so that we can compare it later 
    - wells example in adj list called edges: {0: does not need number, 1:signifies which house has well, i-1}
    - this way wells can be compared as potential edges
    - each mst does need at least one well
    - sort edgelist in order from least to greatest
    - create a find and union function for comparison purposes to see is a edge makes a cycle
    - create a temporary counter and cost variable to keep track of what to return
    - for loop goes through edge list and checks if 2 edges with the least path of resistance belong in a cycle, if not then they are added to the MST with the union function
    - counter is updated
    - so is cost
    - return cost!
