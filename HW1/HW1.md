# High Level Approach:
    - Create a function that removes digits and leaves a fully alphabetical array for comparison
    - create a palindrome checker that basically reverses the array and checks from opposite ends within the same forloop
# The ForLoop:
    - checks if the last letter of the word is the same as the first and iterates through, if none are false then we have a palindrome!
